# Development Document of the svd site #
svd is a short for Spierings v Dijk and is planned to be
a website for the mentioned family.
We will use 'docker' to run 'python' and 'postgresql' in containers. We
will follow the 12 step development philosophy

### Project Structure ###
	- app/		    ~Django project
    - app/settings/ ~Settings folder
	- app/core/	    ~Code shared between multiple apps
	- app/user/     ~User related code
	- app/family/   ~Family related code

### Required applications ###
    - Docker    (installed v27.3.1 docker-compose v2.26.1-desktop.1)
    - Code      (installed v1.94.0)
    - Git       (installed v2.46.2)

### Project setup ###
    - Started this time with this document as first file.
    - GitHub project
        make a new project in github and clone to local machine.
        Make sure SSH works (www.slingacademy.com/article/git-error-permission-denied-publickey/?utm_content=cmp-true):
    - requirements
        Go to base project folder on local machine (svd-dev-api)
        create folder requirements with the files:
            - base.txt
            - development.txt
            - production.txt
    - Docker
        See Dockerfile
        could not run docker build, had to remove json file:  sudo rm ~/.docker/config.json
    - docker compose
        see docker-compose.yml
        docker compose build rebuilds the docker file.
    - linting
        docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "flake8"
    - django-project
        dca "django-admin startproject svd ."
        alias dcu = "docker-compose up"
        alias dcd = "docker-compose down"
    - testing
        alias dca = "docker-compose run --rm app sh -c"
        dca "python manage.py test"
    - refraction
        mkdir -p config/settings
        mv app/svd/settings.py app/config/settings/base.py
        mv app/svd/*.py app/config/
        modify manage.py
        modify config/settings/base.py

### Github Action ###
    - create file :
        mkdir -p .github/workflows/
        touch .github/workflows/check.yml
        see this file.
    - Create access token in dockerhub
    - Copy the token to github secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
    - create docker username in github secrets.DOCKERHUB_NAME
    - These 2 are needed in .github/workflows/check.yml

### Database configuration ###
    To use postgresql we need the extension psycopg3. It has an binary installation
    but the compiled version has better performance and is preferred. For that some
    dependencies are required and has to be added in the Dockerfile.
    Use postgres:17-alpine in docker-compose.yml.
    - add dependencies in the Dockerfile.
    - add psycopg3 in requirements/base.py.
    - docker compose build
    - use django-environ (.env file)
    - Database login credentials in .env
    - change db-settings in settings/base.py to postgresql

django-environ works fine locally, but fails with Git Actions.For the moment we forget the secrets and will investigate this later.

    - Create core app
        An app used for all internal commands and actions. It does not communicate with the website.
        - docker compose run --rm app  sh -c "python manage.py startapp core"
        - mv app/core app/svd/
        - rm app/svd/core/views.py
        - rm app/svd/core/tests.py
        - rm app/svd/core/models.py
        - mkdir app/svd/core/tests

    - Create wait_for_db command
    See course *"Build a Backend REST API with Python & Django 08-configure Database"*
        - mkdir app/svd/core/management
        - touch app/svd/core/management/__init__.py
        - mkdir app/svd/core/management/commands
        - touch app/svd/core/management/commands/__init__.py
        - touch app/svd/core/management/commands/wait_for_db.py
        - First create the test (test_commands.py) before the command
        - Write the command (see: app/svd/core/management/commands/wait_for_db.py)
        - Add wait_for_db command to the check.yml

### Create user model

* Write test
    * touch app/svd/core/tests/test_models
    * Will fail because user model not created yet.
* Create model
    * Base from *AbstractBaseUser* and *PermissionsMixin*.
* Create custom manager
    * Used for CLI integration
* Set AUTH_USER_MODEL in settings/base.py
* Create and run migrations.
* Model AbstractBaseUser:
    * password
    * last_login
    * is_active
